/* ═══════════════════ xAPI (720) — identity ═══════════════════
   Shared by the seven parts of methodica-ar-science-mass-liquid-02, the Arabic twin of
   methodica-science-mass-liquid-02. Loaded first.
   Source: methodica-science-body-matter-01/unit-js/10-identity.js (2026-10-19 state, itself from
   mass-weight-01 ← mass-measure-03), values replaced for this unit on 2026-10-22.

   Arabic identity (2026-11-02): every id is the Hebrew one with /720active/ → /720/ar/ (the prefix
   the other Arabic units use) and "methodica-ar-" for "methodica-", as in metadata/. In Kata there
   is no Arabic unit: the seven Arabic components join the Hebrew unit methodica-science-mass-liquid-02
   (docs-and-tools/send-metadata.ps1, parent-unit mode). XAPI_UNIT_ID stays the Arabic slug, as
   learningUnitId in every component JSON. The storage keys in 40-resume.js carry "ar" too, so Hebrew
   and Arabic state never mix in one browser.
   Procedure: 2026/Documentation/reporting-and-resume/ADDING-REPORTING-AND-RESUME.md.

   Every id the lomda reports is built from these values and must match metadata/*.json byte for
   byte — including the trailing slash, which this unit's catalogue carries on component and item
   ids (not on questions, and not on the unit id, which is a bare slug — see below). Verified
   against metadata/ on 2026-10-22; _test/verify-report.js asserts it, and 50-loader.js compares
   XAPI_COMP_ID with window.METADATA.id on every load and shouts on a mismatch.

   Lowercase everywhere (ids, folder names, storage keys): Kata derives a uniqueKey from the last
   id segment, and currentPartSlug() derives the state key from location.pathname — a capital
   letter would split one learner's progress across two documents. */

/* The unit id — a bare SLUG, not an IRI, equal to metadata/methodica-ar-science-mass-liquid-02_unit.json
   `id` and to `learningUnitId` in every component JSON. MOE v2.5 §2.7 dropped the IRI requirement
   for the content unit only; components and items remain IRIs (hence XAPI_ID_PREFIX above).
   ⚠️ Never replace it with the prefix alone: Kata would take "01" as the uniqueKey and collide with
   every unit 02 of every subject. The issue-report form also posts shortId(learningUnitId) as the
   unit column of the sheet all 720 units share. */

/* Resume (Kata xAPI State API) — ON since Phase 4 (2026-10-22): one state document per component,
   the four hooks (capturePartPayload / applyResumeVars / applyResumeDom / restoreScreenUI) at the
   end of every part's js/main.js, the boot cover in every index.html (docs-and-tools/RESUME.md).
   ⚠️ This flag also changes reporting, not only restoring: it makes 50-loader.js load
   xapi-720-l.js (the build with the State layer and, since 2026-11-13, the leave save) instead of
   xapi-720-i.js, and every part's <head> preloads that exact URL. Do not switch it off to
   debug a restore — use ?resetState. */

/* ── Navigation between parts: off in production, open only for a local walkthrough ──
   The platform (Kata) decides which component comes next: it launches each component on its own,
   with its own ?registration, reads our 'completed' and routes by the catalogue. Any in-unit hop
   would carry window.location.search along — i.e. report the next component under the previous
   component's registration. So every cross-part navigation (the last screen's forward button and
   the first screen's "חזרה") runs only when DEV_NAV is true, which requires BOTH:
     1. ?dev=1 in the URL — only index_dev.html / the developer sets it;
     2. NO ?registration — every Kata launch carries one, so a URL that has it is a real learner
        session, and ?dev=1 does not open navigation there.
   The component 'completed' is never gated on this flag: it is sent by the last click on the last
   screen, and the button is disabled after it. */
